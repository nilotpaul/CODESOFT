              Hideaki Anno is a renowned animator and creator known for his
              groundbreaking work on iconic anime series like "Neon Genesis
              Evangelion." His artistic journey began in his early years, and he
              co-founded Gainax, a studio that produced influential anime works.
              Despite challenges and personal struggles, Anno's creativity has
              left an indelible mark on the world of animation.

            <p>
              Hideaki Anno's early career was marked by a passion for animation
              that began in high school when he showcased his creative talents
              through art and short films for local Japanese Culture festivals.
              This is where he created anime series and films such as ‘The Super
              Dimension Fortress Macross’ and the ‘DAICON’ series.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Anno’s big break, was when he first received recognition for his
              work on Hayao Miyazaki’s 1984 film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the
              Wind.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Soon after, Anno co-founded the animation production studio GAINAX
              in December 1984. He lead the studio in releasing in projects that
              would later become famous works.

              class="eva__img"
            />
            <p>
              Anno’s boost to fame was the work and creation of the globally
              influential anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995–1996)
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              However during the production of the series, Anno battled a number
              of adversities. With tight deadlines, original scripts were
              abandoned and the ending changed just three months before official
              airing on tv. Budget restrictions, scheduling issues and lack of
              resources within the GAINAX studio caused major setbacks and
              hurdles for Anno.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On top of these constraints, Anno himself was going through a
              period of clinical depression. This state was the reason behind
              many of the psychological elements portrayed within the series,
              characters and especially the ending of the series.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the end, Evangelion received mixed praises and criticisms. Also
              creating a lot of controversy.

              "Neon Genesis Evangelion" had its fair share of production
              challenges that lead to a less-ideal original ending. However,
              despite all that I would still say it was pretty legendary.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In 1997, "The End of Evangelion" movie which is considered to be
              an alternate ending to the original series brought closure to many
              characters, and in eyes of many including mine, surpassed the main
              series.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Years later, the release of the "Rebuild of Evangelion" movie
              series breathed new life into the franchise. While these movies
              may not have reached the same heights as the main series, they
              managed to provide fans with a satisfying and joyful ending.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              These reflections not only celebrate Anno's work but also
              highlight the evolving and enduring nature of the "Evangelion"
              universe and the profound impact it has had on me and others.
